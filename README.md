# fuzzy-adventure

A simple JavaScript game design project as an introduction to JavaScript and a building block for the future Bit Crusade project.  

## Objectives

The end goal of this project will be to design a level where a character will be able to navigate around the game window.

I hope to be able to take from this project several key factors:
- how to build out a character class and import it into the index.js
- how to make a container screen for the game and how to fit it to the size of the computer monitor
- how to bind character movement to keys
- how to add a basic sprite to an object, be it a character, npc, obstacle, or background
- how to create a score counter to track the progress the player is making in the game and display it at the top of the screen

## Usage and Installation

TBA.
